# JFS-Project-Guess-the-Number
The "Guess the Number" game is a classic, text-based Java application that provides an entertaining and interactive way for users to test their guessing skills. In this project, you will create a Java program that generates a random number within a specified range and challenges the user to guess that number within a limited number of attempts.
